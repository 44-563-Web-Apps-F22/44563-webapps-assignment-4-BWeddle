        <h3>Act I</h3>
        <h3>Scene: The fishing village of Rederring (in Cornwall).  Rose
            Maybud's cottage is seen L.</h3>
        <p>
            ZORAH.&emsp;Hour by hour and day by day, <br>
            Months have passed away.<br>
            <br>
            CHORUS.&emsp;Fair is Rose as bright Mayday, etc.<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(Enter Dame Hannah, from cottage.)<br>
                 <br>
            &emsp;HANNAH.&ensp;Nay, gentle maidens, you sing well but vainly, for<br>
            Rose is still heart-free, and looks but coldly upon her many<br>
            suitors.<br>
            &emsp;ZORAH.&ensp;It's very disappointing.  Every young man in the<br>
            village is in love with her, but they are appalled by her beauty<br>
            and modesty, and won't declare themselves; so, until she makes<br>
            her own choice, there's no chance for anybody else.<br>
            &emsp;RUTH.&ensp;This is, perhaps, the only village in the world that<br>
            possesses an endowed corps of professional bridesmaids who are<br>
            bound to be on duty every day from ten to four—and it is at<br>
            least six months since our services were required.  The pious<br>
            charity by which we exist is practically wasted!<br>
            &emsp;ZOR.&ensp;We shall be disendowed—that will be the end of it!<br>
            Dame Hannah—you're a nice old person—you could marry if you<br>
            liked.  There's old Adam—Robin's faithful servant—he loves you<br>
            with all the frenzy of a boy of fourteen.<br>
            &emsp;HAN.&ensp;Nay—that may never be, for I am pledged!<br>
            &emsp;ALL.&ensp;To whom?<br>
            &emsp;HAN.&ensp;To an eternal maidenhood!  Many years ago I was<br>
            betrothed to a god-like youth who woo'd me under an assumed name.<br>
            But on the very day upon which our wedding was to have been<br>
            celebrated, I discovered that he was no other than Sir Roderic<br>
            Murgatroyd, one of the bad Baronets of Ruddigore, and the uncle<br>
            of the man who now bears that title.  As a son of that accursed<br>
            race he was no husband for an honest girl, so, madly as I loved<br>
            him, I left him then and there.  He died but ten years since, but<br>
            I never saw him again.<br>
            &emsp;ZOR.&ensp;But why should you not marry a bad Baronet of<br>
            Ruddigore?<br>
            &emsp;RUTH.&ensp;All baronets are bad; but was he worse than other<br>
            baronets?<br>
            &emsp;HAN.&ensp;My child, he was accursed.<br>
            &emsp;ZOR.&ensp;But who cursed him?  Not you, I trust!<br>
            &emsp;HAN.&ensp;The curse is on all his line and has been, ever since<br>
            the time of Sir Rupert, the first Baronet.  Listen, and you shall<br>
            hear the legend:<br>
            <br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;LEGEND—HANNAH.<br>
            <br>
            Sir Rupert Murgatroyd<br>
            His leisure and his riches<br>
            He ruthlessly employed<br>
            In persecuting witches.<br>
            With fear he'd make them quake—<br>
            He'd duck them in his lake—<br>
            He'd break their bones<br>
            With sticks and stones,<br>
            And burn them at the stake!<br>
            <br>
            CHORUS.         This sport he much enjoyed,<br>
            Did Rupert Murgatroyd—<br>
            No sense of shame<br>
            Or pity came<br>
            To Rupert Murgatroyd!<br>
            <br>
            Once, on the village green,<br>
            A palsied hag he roasted,<br>
            And what took place, I ween,<br>
            Shook his composure boasted;<br>
            For, as the torture grim<br>
            Seized on each withered limb,<br>
            The writhing dame<br>
            `Mid fire and flame<br>
            Yelled forth this curse on him:<br>
            <br>
            "Each lord of Ruddigore,<br>
            Despite his best endeavour,<br>
            Shall do one crime, or more,<br>
            Once, every day, for ever!<br>
            This doom he can't defy,<br>
            However he may try,<br>
            For should he stay<br>
            His hand, that day<br>
            In torture he shall die!"<br>
            <br>
            The prophecy came true:<br>
            Each heir who held the title<br>
            Had, every day, to do<br>
            Some crime of import vital;<br>
            Until, with guilt o'erplied,<br>
            "I'll sin no more!" he cried,<br>
            And on the day<br>
            He said that say,<br>
            In agony he died!<br>
            <br>
            CHORUS.        And thus, with sinning cloyed,<br>
            Has died each Murgatroyd,<br>
            And so shall fall,<br>
            Both one and all,<br>
            Each coming Murgatroyd!<br>
            <br>
            (Exeunt Chorus of Bridesmaids.)<br>
            <br>
            (Enter Rose Maybud from cottage, with small basket on her arm.)<br>
            <br>
            HAN.&ensp;Whither away, dear Rose?  On some errand of charity,<br>
            as is thy wont?<br>
            ROSE.&ensp;A few gifts, dear aunt, for deserving villagers.  Lo,<br>
            here is some peppermint rock for old gaffer Gadderby, a set of<br>
            false teeth for pretty little Ruth Rowbottom, and a pound of<br>
            snuff for the poor orphan girl on the hill.<br>
            HAN.&ensp;Ah, Rose, pity that so much goodness should not help<br>
            to make some gallant youth happy for life!  Rose, why dost thou<br>
            harden that little heart of thine?  Is there none hereaway whom<br>
            thou couldst love?<br>
            ROSE.&ensp;And if there were such an one, verily it would ill<br>
            become me to tell him so.<br>
            HAN.&ensp;Nay, dear one, where true love is, there is little<br>
            need of prim formality.<br>
            ROSE.&ensp;Hush, dear aunt, for thy words pain me sorely.  Hung<br>
            in a plated dish-cover to the knocker of the workhouse door, with<br>
            naught that I could call mine own, save a change of baby-linen<br>
            and a book of etiquette, little wonder if I have always regarded<br>
            that work as a voice from a parent's tomb.  This hallowed volume<br>
            (producing a book of etiquette), composed, if I may believe the<br>
            title-page, by no less an authority than the wife of a Lord<br>
            Mayor, has been, through life, my guide and monitor.  By its<br>
            solemn precepts I have learnt to test the moral worth of all who<br>
            approach me.  The man who bites his bread, or eats peas with a<br>
            knife, I look upon as a lost creature, and he who has not<br>
            acquired the proper way of entering and leaving a room is the<br>
            object of my pitying horror.  There are those in this village who<br>
            bite their nails, dear aunt, and nearly all are wont to use their<br>
            pocket combs in public places.  In truth I could pursue this<br>
            painful theme much further, but behold, I have said enough.<br>
                HAN.&ensp;But is there not one among them who is faultless, in<br>
            thine eyes?  For example—young Robin.  He combines the manners<br>
            of a Marquis with the morals of a Methodist.  Couldst thou not<br>
            love him?<br>
                ROSE.&ensp;And even if I could, how should I confess it unto<br>
            him?  For lo, he is shy, and sayeth naught!<br>
            <br>
                                    BALLAD—ROSE.<br>
                                    <br>
                            If somebody there chanced to be<br>
                                Who loved me in a manner true,<br>
                             My heart would point him out to me,<br>
                                And I would point him out to you.<br>
            (Referring     But here it says of those who point—<br>
            to book.)      Their manners must be out of joint—<br>
                                       You may not point—<br>
                                       You must not point—<br>
                                It's manners out of joint, to point!<br>
                      <br>
                            Ah! Had I the love of such as he,<br>
                                Some quiet spot he'd take me to,<br>
                            Then he could whisper it to me,<br>
                                And I could whisper it to you.<br>
            (Referring     But whispering, I've somewhere met,<br>
            to book.)      Is contrary to etiquette:<br>
                                    Where can it be (Searching book.)<br>
                                    Now let me see—(Finding reference.)<br>
                                            Yes, yes!<br>
                            It's contrary to etiquette!<br>
                 <br>
                                (Showing it to Dame Hannah.)<br>
                     <br>
                            If any well-bred youth I knew,<br>
                                Polite and gentle, neat and trim,<br>
                            Then I would hint as much to you,<br>
                                And you could hint as much to him.<br>
            (Referring     But here it says, in plainest print,<br>
            to book.)           "It's most unladylike to hint"—<br>
                                    You may not hint,<br>
                                    You must not hint—<br>
                                It says you mustn't hint, in print!<br>
                      <br>
                            Ah! And if I loved him through and through—<br>
                                (True love and not a passing whim),<br>
                            Then I could speak of it to you,<br>
                                And you could speak of it to him.<br>
            (Referring     But here I find it doesn't do<br>
            to book.)      To speak until you're spoken to.<br>
                                Where can it be?  (Searching book.)<br>
                                Now let me see—(Finding reference.)<br>
                                    Yes, yes!<br>
                            "Don't speak until you're spoken to!"<br>
                                                            (Exit Dame Hannah.)<br>
                                                <br>
                ROSE.&ensp;Poor aunt!  Little did the good soul think, when she<br>
            breathed the hallowed name of Robin, that he would do even as<br>
            well as another.  But he resembleth all the youths in this<br>
            village, in that he is unduly bashful in my presence, and lo, it<br>
            is hard to bring him to the point.  But soft, he is here!<br>
            <br>
                    (Rose is about to go when Robin enters and calls her.)<br>
            <br>
            ROBIN.&ensp;Mistress Rose!<br>
            ROSE.&ensp;(Surprised.)  Master Robin!<br>
            ROB.&ensp;I wished to say that—it is fine.<br>
            ROSE.&ensp;It is passing fine.<br>
            ROB.&ensp;But we do want rain.<br>
            ROSE.&ensp;Aye, sorely! Is that all?<br>
            ROB.&ensp;(Sighing.)  That is all.<br>
            ROSE.&ensp;Good day, Master Robin!<br>
            ROB.&ensp;Good day, Mistress Rose!  (Both going—both stop.)<br>
            ROSE.&ensp;I crave pardon, I—<br>
            ROB.&ensp;I beg pardon, I—<br>
            ROSE.&ensp;You were about to say?—<br>
            ROB.&ensp;I would fain consult you—<br>
            ROSE.&ensp;Truly?<br>
            ROB.&ensp;It is about a friend.<br>
            ROSE.&ensp;In truth I have a friend myself.<br>
            ROB.&ensp;Indeed?  I mean, of course—<br>
            ROSE.&ensp;And I would fain consult you—<br>
            ROB.&ensp;(Anxiously.)  About him?<br>
            ROSE.&ensp;(Prudishly.)  About her.<br>
            ROB.&ensp;(Relieved.)  Let us consult one another.<br>
            <br>  
                                    DUET-ROBIN and ROSE<br>
                          <br>
            ROB.      I know a youth who loves a little maid—<br>
                            (Hey, but his face is a sight for to see!)<br>
                        Silent is he, for he's modest and afraid—<br>
                            (Hey, but he's timid as a youth can be!)<br>
                 <br>
            ROSE.     I know a maid who loves a gallant youth,<br>
                            (Hey, but she sickens as the days go by!)<br>
                        She cannot tell him all the sad, sad truth—<br>
                            (Hey, but I think that little maid will die!)<br>
                 <br>
            ROB.                Poor little man!<br>
  <br>
            ROSE.               Poor little maid!<br>
  <br>
            ROB.                Poor little man!<br>
  <br>
            ROSE.               Poor little maid!<br>
  <br>
            BOTH.     Now tell me pray, and tell me true,<br>
                        What in the world should the (young man\maiden) do?<br>
            <br>
            ROB.      He cannot eat and he cannot sleep—<br>
                            (Hey, but his face is a sight for to see!)<br>
                        Daily he goes for to wail—for to weep—<br>
                            (Hey, but he's wretched as a youth can be!)<br>
                 <br>
            ROSE.     She's very thin and she's very pale—<br>
                            (Hey, but she sickens as the days go by!)<br>
                        Daily she goes for to weep—for to wail—<br>
                            (Hey, but I think that little maid will die!)<br>
                 <br>
            ROB.                Poor little maid!<br>
  <br>
            ROSE.               Poor little man!<br>
  <br>
            ROB.                Poor little maid!<br>
  <br>
            ROSE.               Poor little man!<br>
  <br>
            BOTH.     Now tell me pray, and tell me true,<br>
                        What in the world should the (young man\maiden) do?<br>
            <br>
            ROSE.     If I were the youth I should offer her my name—<br>
                            (Hey, but her face is a sight for to see!)<br>
                 <br>
            ROB.      If were the maid I should fan his honest flame—<br>
                            (Hey, but he's bashful as a youth can be!)<br>
                 <br>
            ROSE.     If I were the youth I should speak to her to-day—<br>

                 <br>
            ROB.      If I were the maid I should meet the lad half way—<br>
                            (For I really do believe that timid youth will<br>
                                die!)<br>
                      <br>
            ROSE.     Poor little man!<br>
  <br>
            ROB.      Poor little maid!<br>
  <br>
            ROSE.     Poor little man!<br>
  <br>
            ROB.      Poor little maid!<br>
  <br>
            BOTH.     I thank you, (miss\sir), for your counsel true;<br>
                            I'll tell that (youth\maid) what (he\she) ought to<br>
                                do!<br>
                                                                (Exit ROSE.)<br>
                                                       <br>
                ROB.&ensp;Poor child!  I sometimes think that if she wasn't<br>
            quite so particular I might venture—but no, no—even then I<br>
            should be unworthy of her!<br>
  <br>
                            (He sits desponding.  Enter Old Adam.)<br>
                  <br>
                ADAM.&ensp;My kind master is sad!  Dear Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd—<br>
                ROB.&ensp;Hush! As you love me, breathe not that hated name.<br>
            Twenty years ago, in horror at the prospect of inheriting that<br>
            hideous title, and with it the ban that compels all who succeed<br>
            to the baronetcy to commit at least one deadly crime per day, for<br>
            life, I fled my home, and concealed myself in this innocent<br>
            village under the name of Robin Oakapple.  My younger brother,<br>
            Despard, believing me to be dead, succeeded to the title and its<br>
            attendant curse.  For twenty years I have been dead and buried.<br>
            Don't dig me up now.<br>
                ADAM.&ensp;Dear master, it shall be as you wish, for have I not<br>
            sworn to obey you for ever in all things?  Yet, as we are here<br>
            alone, and as I belong to that particular description of good old<br>
            man to whom the truth is a refreshing novelty, let me call you by<br>
            your own right title once more!  (Robin assents.)  Sir Ruthven<br>
            Murgatroyd!  Baronet!  Of Ruddigore!  Whew!  It's like eight<br>
            hours at the seaside!<br>
                ROB.&ensp;My poor old friend!  Would there were more like you!<br>
                ADAM.&ensp;Would there were indeed!  But I bring you good<br>
            tidings.  Your foster-brother, Richard, has returned from<br>
            sea—his ship the Tom-Tit rides yonder at anchor, and he himself<br>
            is even now in this very village!<br>
                ROB.&ensp;My beloved foster-brother?  No, no—it cannot be!<br>
                ADAM.&ensp;It is even so—and see, he comes this way!<br>
                                                            (Exeunt together.)<br>
                                                <br>
                                (Enter Chorus of Bridesmaids.)<br>
                       <br>
                                            CHORUS.<br>
                                   <br>
                        From the briny sea<br>
                            Comes young Richard, all victorious!<br>
                        Valorous is he—<br>
                            His achievements all are glorious!<br>
                        Let the welkin ring<br>
                        With the news we bring<br>
                            Sing it—shout it—<br>
                            Tell about it—<br>
                        Safe and sound returneth he,<br>
                        All victorious from the sea!<br>
            <br>
            (Enter Richard.  The girls welcome him as he greets old<br>
                acquaintances.)<br>
       <br>
                                        BALLAD—RICHARD.<br>
                             <br>
                        I shipped, d'ye see, in a Revenue sloop,<br>
                            And, off Cape Finistere,<br>
                                A merchantman we see,<br>
                                A Frenchman, going free,<br>
                            So we made for the bold Mounseer,<br>
                                D'ye see?<br>
                            We made for the bold Mounseer.<br>
                 <br>
            CHORUS.        So we made for the bold Mounseer,<br>
                                D'ye see?<br>
                            We made for the bold Mounseer.<br>
                 <br>
                        But she proved to be a Frigate—and she up with her<br>
                            ports,<br>
                            And fires with a thirty-two!<br>
                                It come uncommon near,<br>
                                But we answered with a cheer,<br>
                            Which paralysed the Parley-voo,<br>
                                    D'ye see?<br>
                            Which paralysed the Parley-voo!<br>
                 <br>
            CHORUS.        Which paralysed the Parley-voo,<br>

                            <br>
                        Then our Captain he up and he says, says he,<br>
                            "That chap we need not fear,—<br>
                                We can take her, if we like,<br>
                                She is sartin for to strike,<br>
                            For she's only a darned Mounseer,<br>
                                    D'ye see?<br>
                            She's only a darned Mounseer!"<br>
                 <br>
            CHORUS.        For she's only a darned Mounseer,<br>
                                    D'ye see?<br>
                            She's only a darned Mounseer!<br>
                 <br>
                        "But to fight a French fal-lal—it's like hittin' of a<br>
                            gal!<br>
                            It's a lubberly thing for to do;<br>
                                For we, with all our faults,<br>
                                Why, we're sturdy British salts,<br>
                            While she's only a Parley-voo,<br>
                                    D'ye see?<br>
                            While she's only a poor Parley-voo!"<br>
                 <br>
            CHORUS.        While she's only a Parley-voo,<br>

                            While she's only a poor Parley-voo!'<br>
                 <br>
                        So we up with our helm, and we scuds before the breeze<br>
                            As we gives a compassionating cheer;<br>
                                Froggee answers with a shout<br>
                                As he sees us go about,<br>
                            Which was grateful of the poor Mounseer,<br>
