            Nay, gentle maidens, you sing well but vainly, for<br>
            Rose is still heart-free, and looks but coldly upon her many<br>
            suitors.<br>

            It's very disappointing.  Every young man in the<br>
            village is in love with her, but they are appalled by her beauty<br>
            and modesty, and won't declare themselves; so, until she makes<br>
            her own choice, there's no chance for anybody else.<br>

            This is, perhaps, the only village in the world that<br>
            possesses an endowed corps of professional bridesmaids who are<br>
            bound to be on duty every day from ten to four—and it is at<br>
            least six months since our services were required.  The pious<br>
            charity by which we exist is practically wasted!<br>

            Dame Hannah—you're a nice old person—you could marry if you<br>
            liked.  There's old Adam—Robin's faithful servant—he loves you<br>

            To an eternal maidenhood!  Many years ago I was<br>
            betrothed to a god-like youth who woo'd me under an assumed name.<br>
            But on the very day upon which our wedding was to have been<br>
            celebrated, I discovered that he was no other than Sir Roderic<br>
            Murgatroyd, one of the bad Baronets of Ruddigore, and the uncle<br>
            of the man who now bears that title.  As a son of that accursed<br>
            race he was no husband for an honest girl, so, madly as I loved<br>
            him, I left him then and there.  He died but ten years since, but<br>
            I never saw him again.<br>
