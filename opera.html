        <h3>Scene: The fishing village of Rederring (in Cornwall).  Rose
            Maybud's cottage is seen L.</h3>
        
        <h4>ZORAH.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            Hour by hour and day by day, <br>
            Months have passed away.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>CHORUS.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            Fair is Rose as bright Mayday, etc.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            (Enter Dame Hannah, from cottage.)<br>
        </p>
        <h4>HANNAH.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            Nay, gentle maidens, you sing well but vainly, for<br>
            Rose is still heart-free, and looks but coldly upon her many<br>
            suitors.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>ZORAH.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            It's very disappointing.  Every young man in the<br>
            village is in love with her, but they are appalled by her beauty<br>
            and modesty, and won't declare themselves; so, until she makes<br>
            her own choice, there's no chance for anybody else.<br>
        </p>

        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            This is, perhaps, the only village in the world that<br>
            possesses an endowed corps of professional bridesmaids who are<br>
            bound to be on duty every day from ten to four—and it is at<br>
            least six months since our services were required.  The pious<br>
            charity by which we exist is practically wasted!<br>
        </p>
        <h4>ZOR.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            We shall be disendowed—that will be the end of it!<br>
            Dame Hannah—you're a nice old person—you could marry if you<br>
            liked.  There's old Adam—Robin's faithful servant—he loves you<br>
            with all the frenzy of a boy of fourteen.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>HAN.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            Nay—that may never be, for I am pledged!<br>
        </p>
        <h4>ALL.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            To whom?<br>
        </p>
        <h4>HAN.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            To an eternal maidenhood!  Many years ago I was<br>
            betrothed to a god-like youth who woo'd me under an assumed name.<br>
            But on the very day upon which our wedding was to have been<br>
            celebrated, I discovered that he was no other than Sir Roderic<br>
            Murgatroyd, one of the bad Baronets of Ruddigore, and the uncle<br>
            of the man who now bears that title.  As a son of that accursed<br>
            race he was no husband for an honest girl, so, madly as I loved<br>
            him, I left him then and there.  He died but ten years since, but<br>
            I never saw him again.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>ZOR.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            But why should you not marry a bad Baronet of<br>
            Ruddigore?<br>
        </p>
        <h4>RUTH.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            All baronets are bad; but was he worse than other<br>
            baronets?<br>
        </p>
        <h4>HAN.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            My child, he was accursed.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>ZOR.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            But who cursed him?  Not you, I trust!<br>
        </p>
        <h4>HAN.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            The curse is on all his line and has been, ever since<br>
            the time of Sir Rupert, the first Baronet.  Listen, and you shall<br>
            hear the legend:<br>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 70px;">
            LEGEND—HANNAH.<br>
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
            Sir Rupert Murgatroyd<br>
            His leisure and his riches<br>
            He ruthlessly employed<br>
            In persecuting witches.<br>
            With fear he'd make them quake—<br>
            He'd duck them in his lake—<br>
            He'd break their bones<br>
            With sticks and stones,<br>
            And burn them at the stake!<br>
        </p>
        <h4>CHORUS.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
            This sport he much enjoyed,<br>
            Did Rupert Murgatroyd—<br>
            No sense of shame<br>
            Or pity came<br>
            To Rupert Murgatroyd!<br>
            <br>
            Once, on the village green,<br>
            A palsied hag he roasted,<br>
            And what took place, I ween,<br>
            Shook his composure boasted;<br>
            For, as the torture grim<br>
            Seized on each withered limb,<br>
            The writhing dame<br>
            `Mid fire and flame<br>
            Yelled forth this curse on him:<br>
            <br>
            "Each lord of Ruddigore,<br>
            Despite his best endeavour,<br>
            Shall do one crime, or more,<br>
            Once, every day, for ever!<br>
            This doom he can't defy,<br>
            However he may try,<br>
            For should he stay<br>
            His hand, that day<br>
            In torture he shall die!"<br>
            <br>
            The prophecy came true:<br>
            Each heir who held the title<br>
            Had, every day, to do<br>
            Some crime of import vital;<br>
            Until, with guilt o'erplied,<br>
            "I'll sin no more!" he cried,<br>
            And on the day<br>
            He said that say,<br>
            In agony he died!<br>
        </p>
        <h4>CHORUS.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
            And thus, with sinning cloyed,<br>
            Has died each Murgatroyd,<br>
            And so shall fall,<br>
            Both one and all,<br>
            Each coming Murgatroyd!<br>
        </p>

            (Exeunt CHORUS. of Bridesmaids.)<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            (Enter Rose Maybud from cottage, with small basket on her arm.)<br>
        </p>
        <h4>HAN.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            Whither away, dear Rose?  On some errand of charity,<br>
            as is thy wont?<br>
        </p>
        <h4>ROSE.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            A few gifts, dear aunt, for deserving villagers.  Lo,<br>
            here is some peppermint rock for old gaffer Gadderby, a set of<br>
            false teeth for pretty little Ruth Rowbottom, and a pound of<br>
            snuff for the poor orphan girl on the hill.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>HAN.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            Ah, Rose, pity that so much goodness should not help<br>
            to make some gallant youth happy for life!  Rose, why dost thou<br>
            harden that little heart of thine?  Is there none hereaway whom<br>
            thou couldst love?<br>
        </p>
        <h4>ROSE.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            And if there were such an one, verily it would ill<br>
            become me to tell him so.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>HAN.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            Nay, dear one, where true love is, there is little<br>
            need of prim formality.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>ROSE.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            Hush, dear aunt, for thy words pain me sorely.  Hung<br>
            in a plated dish-cover to the knocker of the workhouse door, with<br>
            naught that I could call mine own, save a change of baby-linen<br>
            and a book of etiquette, little wonder if I have always regarded<br>
            that work as a voice from a parent's tomb.  This hallowed volume<br>
            (producing a book of etiquette), composed, if I may believe the<br>
            title-page, by no less an authority than the wife of a Lord<br>
            Mayor, has been, through life, my guide and monitor.  By its<br>
            solemn precepts I have learnt to test the moral worth of all who<br>
            approach me.  The man who bites his bread, or eats peas with a<br>
            knife, I look upon as a lost creature, and he who has not<br>
            acquired the proper way of entering and leaving a room is the<br>
            object of my pitying horror.  There are those in this village who<br>
            bite their nails, dear aunt, and nearly all are wont to use their<br>
            pocket combs in public places.  In truth I could pursue this<br>
            painful theme much further, but behold, I have said enough.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>HAN.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            But is there not one among them who is faultless, in<br>
            thine eyes?  For example—young Robin.  He combines the manners<br>
            of a Marquis with the morals of a Methodist.  Couldst thou not<br>
            love him?<br>
        </p>
        <h4>ROSE.</h4>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
            And even if I could, how should I confess it unto<br>
            him?  For lo, he is shy, and sayeth naught!<br>

            If somebody there chanced to be<br>
            Who loved me in a manner true,<br>
            My heart would point him out to me,<br>
            And I would point him out to you.<br>
            But here it says of those who point—<br>
            Their manners must be out of joint—<br>
            You may not point—<br>
            You must not point—<br>
            It's manners out of joint, to point!<br>
            <br>
            (Referring to book.)<br>
            Ah! Had I the love of such as he,<br>
            Some quiet spot he'd take me to,<br>
            Then he could whisper it to me,<br>
            And I could whisper it to you.<br>
            But whispering, I've somewhere met,<br>
            Is contrary to etiquette:<br>
            Where can it be (Searching book.)<br>
            Now let me see—(Finding reference.)<br>
            Yes, yes!<br>
            It's contrary to etiquette!<br>

            (Referring to book.)<br>
            If any well-bred youth I knew,<br>
            Polite and gentle, neat and trim,<br>
            Then I would hint as much to you,<br>
            And you could hint as much to him.<br>
            But here it says, in plainest print,<br>
            "It's most unladylike to hint"—<br>
            You may not hint,<br>
            You must not hint—<br>
            It says you mustn't hint, in print!<br>
            <br>
            (Referring to book.)<br>
            Ah! And if I loved him through and through—<br>
            (True love and not a passing whim),<br>
            Then I could speak of it to you,<br>
            And you could speak of it to him.<br>
            But here I find it doesn't do<br>
            To speak until you're spoken to.<br>
            Where can it be?  (Searching book.)<br>
            Now let me see—(Finding reference.)<br>
            Yes, yes!<br>

            Poor aunt!  Little did the good soul think, when she<br>
            breathed the hallowed name of Robin, that he would do even as<br>
            well as another.  But he resembleth all the youths in this<br>
            village, in that he is unduly bashful in my presence, and lo, it<br>
            is hard to bring him to the point.  But soft, he is here!<br>
