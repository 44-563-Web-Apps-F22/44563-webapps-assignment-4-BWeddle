            To an eternal maidenhood!  Many years ago I was<br>
            betrothed to a god-like youth who woo'd me under an assumed name.<br>
            But on the very day upon which our wedding was to have been<br>
            celebrated, I discovered that he was no other than Sir Roderic<br>
            Murgatroyd, one of the bad Baronets of Ruddigore, and the uncle<br>
            of the man who now bears that title.  As a son of that accursed<br>
            race he was no husband for an honest girl, so, madly as I loved<br>
            him, I left him then and there.  He died but ten years since, but<br>
            I never saw him again.<br>

            The writhing dame<br>
            `Mid fire and flame<br>

            Once, every day, for ever!<br>

            naught that I could call mine own, save a change of baby-linen<br>

            title-page, by no less an authority than the wife of a Lord<br>
            Mayor, has been, through life, my guide and monitor.  By its<br>
            solemn precepts I have learnt to test the moral worth of all who<br>
            approach me.  The man who bites his bread, or eats peas with a<br>
            knife, I look upon as a lost creature, and he who has not<br>
            acquired the proper way of entering and leaving a room is the<br>
            object of my pitying horror.  There are those in this village who<br>
            bite their nails, dear aunt, and nearly all are wont to use their<br>
            pocket combs in public places.  In truth I could pursue this<br>
